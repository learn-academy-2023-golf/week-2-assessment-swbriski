# ASSESSMENT 2: Interview Practice Questions

Answer the following questions.

First, without external resources. Challenge yourself to answer from memory as if you were in a job interview. Tip: providing an example can help communicate your point if you struggle with the vocabulary.

Then, research the question to expand on your answer. Even if you feel you have answered the question completely, there is always something more to learn. Write your researched answer in your OWN WORDS.

Type your initials here to confirm you read the instructions: SB

1. What is the difference between a parameter and an argument?

Your answer: A parameter is a placeholder variable. An argument is a value the function invokes that replaces the parameter in the code and the code returns an appropriate output based on the value given by the argument.

Researched answer: Once a parameter is defined, it can be leveraged anywhere inside the function's logic. The argument is the actual content that gets passed through the function and must be a data type recognized by JavaScript.

2. What is the difference between an object and a class?

Your answer: Objects are the intersection of data and behavior. Objects can be given attributes, properties, or methods.

A class is a blueprint for objects. Classes are broad categories of objects that extend attributes, properties, and methods to objects belonging to that class.

Researched answer: Objects consist of collections of key: value pairs. Classes are reusable blocks of code. Classes are named with PascalCase. Objects are alway lowercase.

3. What is iteration?

Your answer: Iterations are used to run blocks of code a set number of times or until a condition is met.

Researched answer: Data types with length properties, such as strings and arrays, are particularly conducive to iterations. For loops are the most common type of iteration in JavaScript.

4. STRETCH: What is hoisting in JavaScript?

Your answer: Hoisting allows variables to be brought to the front of the code.

Researched answer: No matter where functions and variables are declared, hoisting allows them to be moved to the top of their current scope before code execution.

## Looking Ahead: Terms for Next Week

Research and define the following terms to the best of your ability.

1. Spread operator: The spread operator is a non-destructive method of allowing a dynamic number of arguments to be invoked by a function.

2. React: React is a component based JavaScript library.

3. JSX: JSX converts HTML tags into React elements.
